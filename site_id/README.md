# Site Identification

Beginning with the GAGES-II dataset - **gagesII_2011_conterm_all** (Falcone et al., 2010), the **GAGES_StreamTemp_Sites.R** script identifies sites in the USGS NWIS database with daily records of stream temperatures from 2016-2020. These sites are outputted to **AllSites_with_2016_2020.csv**, which contains 659 sites with any temperature measurements between 2016 and 2020. These sites are filtered down to sites with relatively complete data in other scripts.
